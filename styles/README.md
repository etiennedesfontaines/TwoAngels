# TwoAngels

## To do:

### houseKeeping

- folder for HTML files and reroute all necessary file paths

### All Pages

- Responsiveness (laptop, tablet, mobile) (Mobile carousel swipable)
- Copywriting - Copy for Sans park hiking trails https://www.sanparks.org/parks/garden_route/tourism/activities/hiking_nature_walks.php

- HTML head (SEO necessaries) - Image alt text - Accessibility aria lables etc
- CSS refactor (mixins and variables to reduce repetition)
- Hover state for all buttons and nav elements to improve UI
- Background texture rather than plain white?
- Background off white rather than plain white?

### Activities Page

- awaiting image responses from prospective parties... - Implement images
- Should there be a cta at the end of the activities page?

### Images

- export new treatment - Optimise

### Home Page

- Hero Section Design (Solve for banner and implement)

- Testimonial carousel - Testimoninal redesign to include stars and source of review...
- Testimonials - possible to use from trip advisor without their widget?
- Testimonial customer permission to use head shot?
- Activities image - should this image not rather be same height as the suites and cottages images above, just longer, landscape ie a panoramic shot?
- Does page content only render when in the vp? I am experiencing delayed loading of home page content when it is scrolled out of and back into view. I gather this will be reduced with optimisation. Will optimise images first.

### Accomodation pages

- Square meterage for each
- Pet friendly icon to relevant rooms
- Image Carousel - focus and hover need different styles
- Will likely need web components for image carousels - mobile vs desktop
- Hover for image carousel progress indicators
- Repopulate all acc pages aside from luxury
- create and populate full house page

### Contact Page

- user submission conformation (model
- custom popup menu/ http or email client) - lau advise?
- Submission data handling

### Nav Bar

- mobile nav (hamburger menu)
- location signifiers
- Suite naming (Angel's lair)
- Check elevation with Lau and Bash
- dropdown - dead space just beneath copy that causes dropdown to close
- TabIndex for all nav items?
- How to cause dropdown when tabbed to?

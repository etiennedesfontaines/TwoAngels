# TwoAngels

## To do:

- Site still slow, namely the image loading.

  - Uncertain how to optimise further?
  - webP images?
  - Removing gradients from code and applying directly to images.
  - Using Webpack to launch site?

- check responsiveness.

- data submission handling

  - privacy policy agreement arrives in backend but not being sent in email body, but I don't think this matters?

- Changing Domain Name (How to get current site deployed at TwoAngels.co.za)

  - How is the domain served?

- Refactor

  - Readme
  - Design

- Other:

  - Privacy policy page
  - sitemap (XML)
  - Security

- Configuring external dns for a custom domain.
- configuring and apx domain.
- data submission handling
- creating and sending transactional emails (api call to email client).
- async await
- SEO
- semantic html
- image optimisation, lazy loading etc
- jquery libraries for touch swipe functionality
- creating package.json file
- Installing and using node packages

## Issues - GitHub:

- mobile book now button, invisible after use.
- responsiveness for smaller mobile phones
- TabIndex for all nav items?
- Able to swipe carousels even when using desktop.
- Create componenets for reusable elements (time permitting)
- Add variable for 6.4 rem - change other variables so it makes sense in size order and name.
- folder for HTML files and reroute all necessary file paths?
- Seperate @media query style into appropriate style sheets.
- CSS mixins and variables to reduce any unecessary repetition.
- Cards: Device identification to allow JS to better understand whether it needs to populate mobile or desktop card, even when devices are in a landscapte orientation.
- Refactor carousel logic repetition
- Using text-shadow for bold hover state in Nav bar, would prefer to use bold and implement a solution to prevent layout shift. The solutions I tried weren't working and I couldn't afford to allocate more time to this at this point.
- homePage.js and hamburgerMenu.js both have temporary solutions for isMobile. Implement a more effective device detection method/ utilise an appropriate library.
- card population for mobile and desktop both require the page is reloaded to register whether or not it is mobile, consider putting this in a function that allows detection without page reload.

## Questions:

- Do all units include a TV?
